# HoriSEOn -- SEO Marketing Company
# Description
    We were asked to refractor existing code making it more streamlined without changing what the site actually does.
## Issues
    The primary issue for this project was labeling. Most things were labeled <div> making it more difficult to follow. In the CSS there were sections that could have been combined making the CSS more organized also.
## HTML Changes Made
    As stated in the Issues section. The main issue was labeling. So the <div> labels needed to be adjusted to be more descriptive.
        I changed the "header" and "footer" class <div>s to be a <header> and <footer> tags
        I changed the <div> for the <ul> to be a <nav> tag
        For the classes "content" and "benefits" I added in tags like <article> with <section> tags inside of that to make it more organized
    Along with the labels I also added "alt" tags to the images.
## CSS Changes Made
    In CSS I adjusted the tags so that if they were the same as other sections they'd be under one css group. 
    So things like the images in all 3 "content" sections are the same. So I combined them into a single CSS section.
## Collaborators
    While this was done individually, it was done with the aid of my study group.
    Also with instruction from Fil and Daniel.
